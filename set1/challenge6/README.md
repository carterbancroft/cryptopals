# [Cryptopals Set 1 Challenge 6](https://cryptopals.com/sets/1/challenges/6)
This challenge requires breaking repeating key XOR encryption.

## Approach
I wrote 2 detailed articles describing the thought process and the implementation on my blog:
[Breaking Repeating Key XOR, the Theory](https://carterbancroft.com/breaking-repeating-key-xor-theory/)
[Breaking Repeating Key XOR Programmatically](https://carterbancroft.com/breaking-repeating-key-xor-programmatically/)
